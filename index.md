## About
I am now a founding member of Conflux. Before joining the Conflux team, I was a senior researcher at Systems Research Group in Microsoft Research Asia. My expertise is in the design and implementation of distributed systems. I designed and implemented large-scale and highly efficient distributed machine learning systems which were applied in Microsoft products. I earned Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007, and bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2002. My major research interests include distributed transaction processing systems, graph computing engines, and artificial intelligence platforms. I have publications on top conferences in computer system area, such as SOSP, OSDI, NSDI, ATC, EuroSys, SoCC, VLDB, etc. I served as Program Committee Members of OSDI, ASPLOS, HotDep, and MiddleWare, and also the Publication Chair of SOSP'17.

My research interests include distributed system, transaction processing system, blockchain system, distributed graph engine, machine learning, and deep learning framework, etc.
